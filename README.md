# ScriptCraft Plugin expansion pack
# Install:
Download [CanaryMod](www.canarymod.org) and [ScriptCraft](???).
On Desktop, create a folder named CanaryMod and drag the CanaryMod jar file into the folder. I would recommend renaming the jar canarymod.jar.
Run canarymod.jar once so that it can generate it's file system.
